# my-portfolio
I have designed and developed a professional portfolio  website to showcase my skills and projects an organized manner.
The website includes a home page with an introduction to who I am, an about page with
                        detailed information about my background and interest. A project page that showcases my
                        previous work, and a contact page . The website is designed using modern
                        web technologies such as HTML , CSS , JavaScript, for user experience, and accessibility. The
                        portfolio website helps me increase
                        my visibility, credibility, and opportunities in my professional network.
